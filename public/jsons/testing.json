His newly formed America PAC has come under fire for its voter registration practices[2]. The PAC's website appears to collect personal data from users in swing states without providing direct voter registration assistance, raising questions about data privacy and political targeting[2].\n\n## AI Developments\n\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Musk's xAI company continues to make strides with its Grok AI model. Musk has been vocal about the importance of AI in various applications, including content curation on X[1].\n\n## Business and Innovation\n\nTesla and SpaceX, Musk's flagship companies, continue to push boundaries in their respective fields. While specific updates from yesterday are limited, both companies remain at the forefront of electric vehicle technology and space exploration.\n\nAs always, Musk's actions and statements continue to generate both excitement and controversy across multiple industries and political spheres.

                            "image_prompt": "Photorealistic style, the image captures a wide shot of Sherlock Holmes' study at 221B Baker Street, brimming with intrigue and anticipation. Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes stands confidently in the center of the room, wearing his signature gray tweed suit now paired with an Inverness cape. His posture is straight and self-assured, his sharp pale blue-green eyes gleaming with determination. Martin Freeman as Dr. John Watson has just entered the frame, moving to stand beside Holmes. He's dressed in a brown tweed suit with a beige waistcoat and red bow tie, topped with a bowler hat. His expression is attentive and slightly bemused, his warm brown eyes looking towards Holmes with a mix of admiration and curiosity. The wall behind them is covered in an intricate web of newspaper clippings, photographs, and hand-written notes connected by red string, indicating the complexity of the case. This 'detective's wall' spans from floor to ceiling, showcasing the depth of Holmes' investigative process. The room is lit by a combination of warm gaslight lamps and the cool blue light of early dawn peeking through the windows, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. This lighting emphasizes the transition from night to day, symbolizing the start of a new adventure. In the foreground, Holmes' desk is visible, cluttered with scientific equipment, a violin, and a Persian slipper holding tobacco, all trademark elements of his character. Books line the shelves, and various Victorian-era curiosities are scattered throughout the room, adding depth and authenticity to the setting. The overall atmosphere is one of excitement and readiness, with Holmes and Watson poised to embark on their latest challenging case. The image captures the essence of their partnership and the promise of a thrilling mystery about to unfold.",

It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer ‚Äì excellent for drawing the veil from men‚Äôs motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.",

My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.",

As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.",

The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o‚Äôclock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.",

A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.",

It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.‚Äù",

But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Very truly yours, ‚ÄúIRENE NORTON, n√©e ADLER.‚Äù",

            "original_script": "To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer ‚Äì excellent for drawing the veil from men‚Äôs motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\nOne night ‚Äì it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 ‚Äì I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n‚ÄúWedlock suits you,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSeven!‚Äù I answered.\n‚ÄúIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, how do you know?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?‚Äù\n‚ÄúMy dear Holmes,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can‚Äôt imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.‚Äù\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n‚ÄúIt is simplicity itself,‚Äù said he; ‚Äúmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.‚Äù\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. ‚ÄúWhen I hear you give your reasons,‚Äù I remarked, ‚Äúthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.‚Äù\n‚ÄúQuite so,‚Äù he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. ‚ÄúYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFrequently.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow often?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWell, some hundreds of times.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen how many are there?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow many? I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù\n‚ÄúQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.‚Äù He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. ‚ÄúIt came by the last post,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúRead it aloud.‚Äù\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n‚ÄúThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o‚Äôclock,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúa gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis is indeed a mystery,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúWhat do you imagine that it means?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?‚Äù\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n‚ÄúThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,‚Äù I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion‚Äôs processes. ‚ÄúSuch paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPeculiar ‚Äì that is the very word,‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúIt is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.‚Äù\nI did so, and saw a large ‚ÄúE‚Äù with a small ‚Äúg,‚Äù a ‚ÄúP,‚Äù and a large ‚ÄúG‚Äù with a small ‚Äút‚Äù woven into the texture of the paper.\n‚ÄúWhat do you make of that?‚Äù asked Holmes.\n‚ÄúThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot at all. The ‚ÄôG‚Äô with the small ‚Äôt‚Äô stands for ‚ÄôGesellschaft,‚Äô which is the German for ‚ÄôCompany.‚Äô It is a customary contraction like our ‚ÄôCo.‚Äô ‚ÄôP,‚Äô of course, stands for ‚ÄôPapier.‚Äô Now for the ‚ÄôEg.‚Äô Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.‚Äù He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. ‚ÄúEglow, Eglonitz ‚Äì here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country ‚Äì in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‚ÄôRemarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.‚Äô Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?‚Äù His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n‚ÄúThe paper was made in Bohemia,‚Äù I said.\n‚ÄúPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence ‚Äì ‚ÄôThis account of you we have from all quarters received.‚Äô A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.‚Äù\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses‚Äô hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\n‚ÄúA pair, by the sound,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he continued, glancing out of the window. ‚ÄúA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There‚Äôs money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI think that I had better go, Holmes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut your client ‚Äì ‚Äù\n‚ÄúNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.‚Äù\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\n‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù said Holmes.\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n‚ÄúYou had my note?‚Äù he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. ‚ÄúI told you that I would call.‚Äù He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n‚ÄúPray take a seat,‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.‚Äù\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. ‚ÄúIt is both, or none,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.‚Äù\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. ‚ÄúThen I must begin,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI promise,‚Äù said Holmes.\n‚ÄúAnd I.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou will excuse this mask,‚Äù continued our strange visitor. ‚ÄúThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was aware of it,‚Äù said Holmes dryly.\n‚ÄúThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was also aware of that,‚Äù murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n‚ÄúIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,‚Äù he remarked, ‚ÄúI should be better able to advise you.‚Äù\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. ‚ÄúYou are right,‚Äù he cried; ‚ÄúI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhy, indeed?‚Äù murmured Holmes. ‚ÄúYour Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut you can understand,‚Äù said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, ‚Äúyou can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, pray consult,‚Äù said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n‚ÄúThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,‚Äù murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n‚ÄúLet me see!‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto ‚Äì hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw ‚Äì yes! Retired from operatic stage ‚Äì ha! Living in London ‚Äì quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPrecisely so. But how ‚Äì ‚Äù\n‚ÄúWas there a secret marriage?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNone.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo legal papers or certificates?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNone.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere is the writing.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPooh, pooh! Forgery.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMy private note-paper.‚Äù\n‚ÄúStolen.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMy own seal.‚Äù\n‚ÄúImitated.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMy photograph.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBought.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe were both in the photograph.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was mad ‚Äì insane.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou have compromised yourself seriously.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt must be recovered.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe have tried and failed.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe will not sell.‚Äù\n‚ÄúStolen, then.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo sign of it?‚Äù\n‚ÄúAbsolutely none.‚Äù\nHolmes laughed. ‚ÄúIt is quite a pretty little problem,‚Äù said he.\n‚ÄúBut a very serious one to me,‚Äù returned the King reproachfully.\n‚ÄúVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo ruin me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut how?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am about to be married.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSo I have heard.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd Irene Adler?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go ‚Äì none.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am sure.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd why?‚Äù\n‚ÄúBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh, then we have three days yet,‚Äù said Holmes with a yawn. ‚ÄúThat is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?‚Äù\n‚ÄúCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, as to money?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou have carte blanche.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAbsolutely?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd for present expenses?‚Äù\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\n‚ÄúThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,‚Äù he said.\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\n‚ÄúAnd Mademoiselle‚Äôs address?‚Äù he asked.\n‚ÄúIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John‚Äôs Wood.‚Äù\nHolmes took a note of it. ‚ÄúOne other question,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúWas the photograph a cabinet?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt was.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,‚Äù he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. ‚ÄúIf you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o‚Äôclock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.‚Äù\nAt three o‚Äôclock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o‚Äôclock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend‚Äôs amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\n‚ÄúWell, really!‚Äù he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\n‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.‚Äù\nQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o‚Äôclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\n‚ÄúI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd what of Irene Adler?‚Äù I asked.\nOh, she has turned all the men‚Äôs heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\n‚ÄúThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman‚Äôs chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am following you closely,‚Äù I answered.\nI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached ‚Äì evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\nHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‚ÄôDrive like the devil,‚Äô he shouted, ‚Äôfirst to Gross & Hankey‚Äôs in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!‚Äô\nAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn‚Äôt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n‚ÄôThe Church of St. Monica, John,‚Äô she cried, ‚Äôand half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.‚Äô\nThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‚ÄôThe Church of St. Monica,‚Äô said I, ‚Äôand half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.‚Äô It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\nMy cabby drove fast. I don‚Äôt think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\n‚ÄôThank God,‚Äô he cried. ‚ÄôYou‚Äôll do. Come! Come!‚Äô\n‚ÄôWhat then?‚Äô I asked.\n‚ÄôCome, man, come, only three minutes, or it won‚Äôt be legal.‚Äô\n‚ÄúI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,‚Äù said I; ‚Äúand what then?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‚ÄôI shall drive out in the park at five as usual,‚Äô she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhich are?‚Äù\n‚ÄúSome cold beef and a glass of beer,‚Äù he answered, ringing the bell. ‚ÄúI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI shall be delighted.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind breaking the law?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot in the least.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNor running a chance of arrest?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot in a good cause.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh, the cause is excellent!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen I am your man.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI was sure that I might rely on you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut what is it you wish?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,‚Äù he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, ‚ÄúI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd what then?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am to be neutral?‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd when I raise my hand ‚Äì so ‚Äì you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?‚Äù\n‚ÄúEntirely.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt is nothing very formidable,‚Äù he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. ‚ÄúIt is an ordinary plumber‚Äôs smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPrecisely.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen you may entirely rely on me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.‚Äù\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes‚Äô succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\n‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, ‚Äúthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhere, indeed?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman‚Äôs dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhere, then?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut it has twice been burgled.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPshaw! They did not know how to look.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut how will you look?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI will not look.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat then?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI will get her to show me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut she will refuse.‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.‚Äù\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\n‚ÄúIs the poor gentleman much hurt?‚Äù she asked.\n‚ÄúHe is dead,‚Äù cried several voices.\n‚ÄúNo, no, there‚Äôs life in him!‚Äù shouted another. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôll be gone before you can get him to hospital.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a brave fellow,‚Äù said a woman. ‚ÄúThey would have had the lady‚Äôs purse and watch if it hadn‚Äôt been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he‚Äôs breathing now.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?‚Äù\n‚ÄúSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!‚Äù\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill ‚Äì gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids ‚Äì joined in a general shriek of ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend‚Äôs arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n‚ÄúYou did it very nicely, Doctor,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúNothing could have been better. It is all right.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou have the photograph?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI know where it is.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd how did you find out?‚Äù\n‚ÄúShe showed me, as I told you she would.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am still in the dark.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI do not wish to make a mystery,‚Äù said he, laughing. ‚ÄúThe matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI guessed as much.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat also I could fathom.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow did that help you?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù I asked.\n‚ÄúOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd when will you call?‚Äù\n‚ÄúAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.‚Äù\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\n‚ÄúGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.‚Äù\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that voice before,‚Äù said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. ‚ÄúNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.‚Äù\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\n‚ÄúYou have really got it!‚Äù he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\n‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut you have hopes?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI have hopes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe must have a cab.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo, my brougham is waiting.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen that will simplify matters.‚Äù We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\n‚ÄúIrene Adler is married,‚Äù remarked Holmes.\n‚ÄúMarried! When?‚Äù\n‚ÄúYesterday.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut to whom?‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo an English lawyer named Norton.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut she could not love him.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am in hopes that she does.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd why in hopes?‚Äù\n‚ÄúBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty‚Äôs plan.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt is true. And yet ‚Äì Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!‚Äù He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\n‚ÄúMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?‚Äù said she.\n‚ÄúI am Mr. Holmes,‚Äù answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\n‚ÄúIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. ‚ÄúDo you mean that she has left England?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNever to return.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd the papers?‚Äù asked the King hoarsely. ‚ÄúAll is lost.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to ‚ÄúSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.‚Äù My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\n‚ÄúWhat a woman ‚Äì oh, what a woman!‚Äù cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. ‚ÄúDid I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?‚Äù\n‚ÄúFrom what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,‚Äù said Holmes coldly. ‚ÄúI am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty‚Äôs business to a more successful conclusion.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOn the contrary, my dear sir,‚Äù cried the King; ‚Äúnothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring ‚Äì ‚Äù He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\n‚ÄúYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,‚Äù said Holmes.\n‚ÄúYou have but to name it.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis photograph!‚Äù\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\n‚ÄúIrene‚Äôs photograph!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúCertainly, if you wish it.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.‚Äù He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman‚Äôs wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\n",
            "translated_script": "This guy Sherlock Holmes, he always calls her ‚ÄúTHE woman.‚Äù I hardly ever hear him call her by her real name. To him, she‚Äôs the only woman in the world.  It's not like he was in love with Irene Adler or anything.  Nope, Holmes hated feelings and stuff, especially love.  He thought they were dumb. He was all about being a super-smart, logical dude - like a human computer. Love would‚Äôve messed up his whole vibe. To him, feelings were just something he observed in other people so he could figure them out, not something he wanted for himself. Can‚Äôt have your brain all mushy when you‚Äôre solving mysteries, right? But yeah, there was only this one woman for him, and she was Irene Adler. And her reputation? Well, it wasn't exactly squeaky clean.\n\nI hadn't seen much of Holmes recently. Ever since I got married, we‚Äôd drifted apart. I was busy being a happy newlywed and all that, which took up all my time.  Meanwhile, Holmes, who hated parties and anything social, was holed up in our Baker Street apartment. He‚Äôd switch between being totally zonked out on cocaine and then suddenly being obsessed with some case or another - talk about an intense guy. He still loved anything to do with crime and used his crazy-good memory and detective skills to solve mysteries that even the cops had given up on. Every once in a while, I‚Äôd hear about some big case he cracked - like that murder in Russia, or the mystery of those brothers in India, or even helping out the royal family in Holland. But besides what I read in the newspapers, I didn't really know what my old friend was up to.\n\nThen one night - March 20th, 1888 - I was coming home from seeing a patient.  Yeah, I was back to being a regular doctor now. Anyway, my walk took me through Baker Street, and as I passed our old place, which brought back a lot of memories, I suddenly felt this urge to see Holmes again and find out what he was up to.  His windows were blazing with light, and as I looked up, I saw his tall, skinny shadow moving back and forth.  He was pacing like crazy, his head down, hands behind his back.  I knew him like the back of my hand, and this meant only one thing: he was on a case.  He‚Äôd shaken off whatever druggy haze he was in and was hot on the trail of something new. I rang the bell.\n\nHe wasn't exactly what you'd call warm and fuzzy when he opened the door, but I could tell he was happy to see me.  He just waved me into our old room without saying much. He pointed to his cigars and drinks, then stood by the fireplace, just studying me with those intense eyes.\n\n‚ÄúMarriage looks good on you,‚Äù he said, out of nowhere. \"I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve put on about seven and a half pounds since I last saw you.\"\n\n‚ÄúSeven?‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, actually, maybe a bit more. Just a tad, I‚Äôd say. And you‚Äôre back at work, I see.  You didn't tell me you were going back to being a doctor.\"\n\n‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFigured it out. It‚Äôs obvious. Like, it‚Äôs pretty clear you've been caught in the rain lately and that you have a totally useless maid.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHolmes, how on earth‚Ä¶?‚Äù I started, but he cut me off.\n\nHe chuckled and rubbed his hands together like he was about to tell a joke.\n\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson! My eyes tell me that on your left shoe, right where the firelight hits it, the leather has six little cuts on it, all almost perfectly parallel. Obviously, someone scraped the mud off your shoes, but did a terrible job. Hence, my friend, you were out in awful weather and you have a maid who should be fired immediately. As for your work, let's just say that when a guy comes in here reeking of medical stuff, has a black stain on his finger, and a lump in his coat pocket shaped exactly like a stethoscope, well, I'd have to be blind not to realize he's a doctor.\"\n\nI couldn't help but laugh; he made it seem so easy! ‚ÄúWhen you explain it,\" I said, \"it's always so simple. I feel like I could do it too, but then you hit me with another one of your deductions, and I'm clueless again.  My eyes are as good as yours, though!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure they are,\" he said, lighting a cigarette and slumping into a chair.  ‚ÄúThe thing is, you see, but you don‚Äôt observe.  Big difference.  For example, you've seen the steps up to this room how many times?‚Äù\n\n\"A lot!\"\n\n\"How many, exactly?\"\n\n\"I don't know, hundreds?\"\n\n\"Exactly! You haven‚Äôt observed. But you‚Äôve seen them. That‚Äôs my whole point. Now me, I‚Äôve both seen and observed, so I know there are seventeen steps. Speaking of little mysteries, since you like that sort of thing and you're writing down all our adventures, this might interest you.‚Äù He threw a pink piece of paper at me.  \"Came in the mail just now,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúRead it out loud.\"\n\nThe note didn't have a date, name, or anything. \n\n‚ÄúA gentleman will call on you tonight at a quarter to eight,‚Äù it read. ‚ÄúHe needs your advice on something extremely important.  People say you can be trusted with top-secret info, what with you helping out those European royals and all. Be in your room, and don‚Äôt freak out if he‚Äôs wearing a mask.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNow that is weird,\" I said.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think it all means?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough info yet,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúBiggest mistake is to start making theories before you have all the facts. You‚Äôll end up twisting the facts to fit your theory instead of the other way around.  Let‚Äôs look at the note itself. What do you make of it?‚Äù\n\nI studied the note and paper carefully.\n\n‚ÄúWell, looks like our mystery man‚Äôs loaded,‚Äù I said, trying to think like Holmes. ‚ÄúThis paper is fancy, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it cost a pretty penny. It‚Äôs thick and stiff, too.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPeculiar, that‚Äôs the right word,\" Holmes said.  ‚ÄúNot even English paper. Hold it up to the light.‚Äù\n\nI did, and saw a big ‚ÄúE‚Äù with a little ‚Äúg‚Äù, then a ‚ÄúP‚Äù, then a big ‚ÄúG‚Äù with a little ‚Äút‚Äù all woven into the paper.\n\n‚ÄúWell?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúProbably the paper company‚Äôs name. Or maybe a logo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNope. The ‚ÄúG‚Äù with the little ‚Äút‚Äù means ‚ÄòGesellschaft,‚Äô which is German for ‚ÄòCompany.‚Äô  Like we shorten it to ‚ÄòCo.‚Äô  ‚ÄúP‚Äù is for ‚ÄòPapier‚Äô - paper, obviously.  Now, for the ‚ÄúEg‚Äù.  Time to consult my trusty Continental Gazetteer!‚Äù  He grabbed a huge book from his shelf.  \"Eglof, Eglonitz‚Ä¶. Ah, here we are: Egria.  It's in Bohemia, where they speak German. Not far from Carlsbad.  Listen to this: ‚ÄòFamous for being where that Wallenstein guy died and also for its glass factories and paper mills.‚Äô  Ha!  Get it?‚Äù  He was practically bouncing in his chair, his eyes bright with excitement, a cloud of smoke puffing from his cigarette.\n\n‚ÄúThe paper was made in Bohemia,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúExactly! Which means our mystery note writer is German. Did you notice how the sentence is structured? ‚ÄòThis account of you we have from all quarters received.‚Äô No Frenchman or Russian would write it like that.  Germans and their verbs, right?  So now we just have to find out what this masked German who uses Bohemian paper wants. And speak of the devil, here he comes now, I do believe.‚Äù\n\nJust then, a carriage screeched to a stop outside.\n\n‚ÄúTwo horses by the sound of it,‚Äù Holmes said. \"Yup, a fancy little carriage and two beautiful horses. Worth a fortune.  This case is interesting already, Watson.\"\n\n\"Maybe I should go, Holmes,\" I said.\n\n‚ÄúNonsense, stay put, Doctor! I‚Äôm lost without my trusty sidekick. Besides, I have a feeling this is gonna be good.  Be a shame to miss it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut what about your client?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you worry about him, I may need your help and so might he. Ah, here he is. You just sit tight and listen closely.‚Äù\n\nWe heard heavy footsteps coming up the stairs and then a loud, commanding knock.\n\n‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù shouted Holmes.\n\nThe guy who walked in was huge, at least six foot six, built like a tank.  He was dressed super expensively, but in a way that would be considered pretty tacky in England. His coat was trimmed with fur, and he had this huge emerald brooch holding his cloak closed. He took off his hat as he came in, but the top half of his face was covered with a black mask. He looked like he‚Äôd just put it on because his hand was still on it.  You could tell he was a strong-willed guy just from the lower half of his face; he had this thick, frowning mouth and a stubborn-looking chin. \n\n‚ÄúYou got my note?‚Äù he asked. His voice was deep and rough, and he had a thick German accent. \"I said I‚Äôd come.\" He glanced back and forth between me and Holmes.\n\n\"Have a seat,‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúThis is my friend, Dr. Watson, he helps me out with cases sometimes. Who should I say is calling?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou can call me Count Von Kramm,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA Bohemian nobleman.  This gentleman, your friend, I assume he‚Äôs trustworthy and can keep a secret? This is a matter of utmost importance. Otherwise, I prefer to speak with you alone.\"\n\nI started to get up, but Holmes grabbed my wrist and pulled me back down. ‚ÄúEither he stays,‚Äù Holmes said, ‚Äúor you‚Äôre talking to an empty room. What you say to me, you can say in front of him.\"\n\nThe Count shrugged.  ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúFirst, I need your word that you will both keep this absolutely secret for two years. After that, it won‚Äôt matter. But right now, let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs a big deal. Could even change European history, important stuff.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI promise,‚Äù said Holmes.\n\n‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll excuse the mask,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe person I work for, he wants to remain anonymous.  Truth be told, ‚ÄúCount‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly my real title either.\"\n\n‚ÄúI knew that already,‚Äù Holmes said casually.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a delicate situation,\" the Count said. \"We need to be careful to prevent a massive scandal that could seriously damage one of the most important families in Europe. To put it bluntly, this involves the House of Ormstein, the royal family of Bohemia.\"\n\n‚ÄúYeah, figured that out too,‚Äù mumbled Holmes, getting comfortable in his chair and closing his eyes like he was bored.\n\nOur visitor seemed surprised. He was probably expecting the most brilliant detective in the world to be a bit more‚Ä¶ alert. Holmes opened his eyes slowly and looked impatiently at his client.\n\n‚ÄúIf you would be so kind as to tell me what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen perhaps I could help you.\"\n\nThe guy jumped up and started pacing, really agitated. Finally, he ripped the mask off his face and chucked it on the floor.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right!‚Äù he shouted,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the King! No point hiding it!\"\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me,‚Äù Holmes said under his breath. ‚ÄúI knew I was talking to Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and King of Bohemia before you even said a word.\"\n\n‚ÄúOf course, of course,‚Äù said the King, sitting back down and wiping his brow.  \"But I don‚Äôt usually do business like this, you know? But this situation, it's just so sensitive. I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone else to handle it.  I had to come to London in disguise just to talk to you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell then, by all means, let‚Äôs talk,‚Äù said Holmes, closing his eyes again.\n\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal: about five years ago, I was in Warsaw for a while and I met this woman, quite the character, name of Irene Adler. You‚Äôve heard of her?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLook her up in my files, would you, Watson?‚Äù Holmes said, not even bothering to open his eyes.  He kept these meticulous records on everyone and everything; it was amazing. I found her file wedged between a rabbi and a naval officer who'd written about fish.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶,‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúHmm, born in New Jersey, 1858.  Contralto‚Ä¶ interesting.  Sang at La Scala‚Ä¶ impressive.  Lead singer at the Imperial Opera in Warsaw, no less.  Retired from singing, huh?  Living in London now, is she?  Let me guess, Your Majesty, you had a little fling with this woman, wrote some letters you probably shouldn‚Äôt have, and now you want them back?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right!  But how did you‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTell me, was there a secret marriage?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAny legal documents? A marriage certificate?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing at all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm not sure I understand the problem, Your Majesty.  If this woman tries to blackmail you with these letters, how can she prove they‚Äôre real?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe handwriting.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, that‚Äôs easy to fake.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was on my personal stationery.\"\n\n‚ÄúCould‚Äôve been stolen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt has my seal on it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSomeone could‚Äôve copied it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy photo‚Äôs in it!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCould‚Äôve bought that.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both in the photo!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh dear, that‚Äôs not good. You really messed up this time.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was a fool!  Out of my mind!\"\n\n‚ÄúThis is serious. You‚Äôve compromised yourself.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was just the Crown Prince back then, I was young and stupid! I‚Äôm only thirty now!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe have to get that photo back.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried everything, nothing worked.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to pay her. Buy it back.\"\n\n‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt sell.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll have to steal it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe tried that five times already! My guys broke into her house twice. Once we stole her luggage when she was traveling. And she was ambushed twice. Nothing!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt find a single clue?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù\n\nHolmes chuckled. ‚ÄúThis is quite a little problem, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge problem for me,‚Äù the King said.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, it is. So what‚Äôs she going to do with this photo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRuin me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut how?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to get married.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, the Scandinavian King‚Äôs second daughter. You must know her family is very strict.  And she‚Äôs the picture of innocence.  Even the tiniest whiff of scandal would end things instantly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd Irene Adler?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to send them that photo, I know she will.  You don‚Äôt know her, she‚Äôs got a will of iron. Most beautiful woman you‚Äôve ever seen, but with the mind of a ruthless criminal. She‚Äôll do anything to stop me from marrying this other woman, anything.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre certain she hasn‚Äôt sent the photo yet?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPositive.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you so sure?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause she told me she would send it the day the engagement is announced.  This Monday.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, good thing we have three days then,‚Äù Holmes said, yawning.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a couple of loose ends to tie up at the moment. Your Majesty will be staying in London for the time being, I presume?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course, of course.  You can reach me at the Langham Hotel, under the name Count Von Kramm.\"\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know how things are going.\"\n\n‚ÄúPlease do, I‚Äôm on pins and needles over here.\"\n\n‚ÄúNow, about payment‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, the sky‚Äôs the limit.\"\n\n‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd give you one of my provinces for that photo, I‚Äôm not kidding.\"\n\n‚ÄúAnd for expenses?‚Äù\n\nThe King took out a fat leather bag and tossed it on the table. ‚ÄúThree hundred in gold, seven hundred in cash,‚Äù he said.\n\nHolmes scribbled him a receipt.  ‚ÄúAnd the lady‚Äôs address?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBriony Lodge, on Serpentine Avenue in St. John‚Äôs Wood.\"\n\nHolmes wrote it down.  ‚ÄúJust one more thing: was the photo a cabinet card?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, it was.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight then, good night, Your Majesty. I think we‚Äôll have good news for you soon. And good night to you too, Watson,‚Äù he said as we heard the royal carriage pulling away.  ‚ÄúCome by tomorrow afternoon around three, we‚Äôll talk about this whole thing.‚Äù\n\nAt three o‚Äôclock sharp, I was back on Baker Street. No sign of Holmes.  His landlady said he‚Äôd left early that morning. So I sat by the fire, waiting. I have to admit, this case had really piqued my interest. Even though it wasn‚Äôt a murder or anything, something about the mystery of the missing photo, and who this Irene Adler really was, not to mention having a king as a client, made it all very intriguing. Plus, it was fascinating to watch Holmes work; he was so incredibly sharp and observant.  I was so used to him being right that I never even considered the possibility of him failing.\n\nIt was almost four when he finally showed up, looking like he‚Äôd been on a bender! He had on these shabby clothes, his face was red and kind of swollen, and he had these ridiculous sideburns. I knew Holmes was a master of disguise, but I swear, I had to look three times before I was sure it was really him!  He gave me a quick nod and disappeared into his bedroom.  Five minutes later, he came out, back to his normal self, wearing his usual tweed suit. He shoved his hands in his pockets, stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and burst out laughing.\n\n‚ÄúYou are not going to believe this!‚Äù he said, but then he started choking and laughing so hard he could barely breathe.  \n\n‚ÄúWhat? What is it?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ too perfect.  You‚Äôll never guess what I‚Äôve been up to all day!‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even imagine. I‚Äôm assuming you went to check out Miss Adler‚Äôs place and see what she's like?\"\n\n‚ÄúBingo.  But you won‚Äôt believe what happened!  I left here around eight this morning, dressed as a groom who was out of work.  Guys who like horses always stick together, did you know that? Easy to blend in, and you learn all sorts of things.  Found Briony Lodge easy enough. Small, but nice, with a garden in the back, right on the street. Two floors.  Basic lock on the door.  Big living room on the right with those huge windows - easy to open, even a kid could do it.  Nothing much in the back, except that you could reach the passage window from the roof of the coach house.  I walked around the whole place, checked it out good, but didn't see anything else important.\n\n\"So I headed down to the end of the street where I figured there‚Äôd be stables, and I was right. I helped the stable boys groom the horses and got a couple pennies, some watered-down beer, a few cigarettes, and more information than I could ever want about our Miss Adler -  not to mention all the gossip about half the neighborhood!  Not that I cared about them, but I had to pretend to be interested.\"\n\n‚ÄúAnd what about Irene Adler? What did you learn?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say all the guys were head over heels for her, she's quite a looker, apparently.  The prettiest woman any of them had ever seen. That's what they all said at the stables, anyway. Quiet life: sings at concerts, goes for a drive at five, home for dinner at seven sharp. Doesn‚Äôt go out much other than for her concerts. Has this one guy who visits her a lot - a good-looking fella with dark hair. Comes at least once a day, sometimes twice.  Name‚Äôs Godfrey Norton, lawyer. See, being a cabby, you learn all sorts of juicy gossip. They‚Äôd driven him home often enough to know everything about him.  So after getting all the dirt, I strolled past Briony Lodge again, planning my next move.\n\n‚ÄúThis Godfrey Norton guy, he‚Äôs a big part of this, I can tell.  Lawyer, that‚Äôs never good. Had to figure out what their deal was. Is she his client?  Friend?  Or something more?  Client, maybe she gave him the photo.  If they were involved, less likely. That was the question, and the answer would determine if I should focus on her place or his. Tricky situation.  Sorry to bore you with all this, but if you‚Äôre going to write all this down, I have to give you the details, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm following,‚Äù I told him.\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúI was still trying to figure out what to do when a cab pulled up, and this guy jumped out.  He fit the description perfectly: handsome, dark, mustache.  Clearly the Norton fellow. And in a hurry, too. Yelled at the cabby to wait, practically pushed past the maid.  \n\n\"He was inside maybe half an hour, pacing back and forth, talking with his hands, totally worked up.  I couldn‚Äôt get a look at her.  Then he came out, even more flustered than before. Checked his watch and yelled at the cabby, ‚ÄòGet me to Gross & Hankey‚Äôs on Regent Street, then St. Monica‚Äôs Church on Edgeware Road - and make it snappy, twenty minutes! You‚Äôll get an extra shilling!‚Äô\n\n\"Off they went, and I was trying to decide if I should follow them, when a fancy little carriage came up.  Coachman looked a mess, but the woman who came rushing out of the house and into the carriage, she was beautiful!  Stunning!\n\n‚ÄúSt. Monica‚Äôs, John!\" she called out to the driver. \"And there‚Äôs a half-sovereign in it for you if you get me there in twenty minutes!\"\n\n‚ÄúWatson, I couldn‚Äôt resist. This was too good!  I was about to chase after them, when an empty cab came by.  The driver didn't look too happy to see me, but I got in before he could say anything. ‚ÄòSt. Monica‚Äôs! And step on it, twenty minutes!  There‚Äôs a reward in it for you!‚Äô  It was a quarter after eleven, and I knew exactly what was about to happen. \n\n‚ÄúThe cabby got us there fast! I swear, I‚Äôve never gone that fast in my life. But the other two, they were already there!  Their horses were steaming; they must‚Äôve really pushed them.  I paid the cabby and raced inside.  There was no one there except for the lovebirds, a priest, and an empty church.  They were huddled together by the altar, and the priest looked like he was arguing with them. I pretended to be some lost soul who wandered in and walked casually down the aisle.  Suddenly, they all turned and looked at me, and Godfrey Norton came running towards me as fast as he could.\n\n‚ÄúThank God!\" he said. \"You‚Äôll do. Come on, come on!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúNo time to explain, man, every second counts! Three minutes, or it won‚Äôt be legal!‚Äù\n\n\"Next thing I know, they‚Äôve practically dragged me up to the altar, whispering stuff in my ear, and I‚Äôm repeating it! Vouching for all these things I know nothing about! Turns out, they needed a witness to make it legal, and there I was, at the right place at the right time!  Saved the day! The bride gave me a sovereign; I‚Äôm going to have to get myself a pocket watch to wear it on. What a day!‚Äù  And that‚Äôs when he‚Äôd started laughing so hard. \n\n‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a twist,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúWhat happened next?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy carefully laid plans were down the drain, that's what! Looked like they were about to take off, so I had to think fast. But then, at the church door, they took off in different directions: he went back to the Temple, she went home. I heard her say to him, ‚ÄòSee you in the park at five, like always.‚Äô  And that was that.  Time to figure something else out.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ what exactly are we going to do?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat first, then I‚Äôll explain everything. It‚Äôs almost five now, we need to be ready in two hours. Miss Irene - or Mrs. Norton, I guess - will be home from her drive around seven. We‚Äôll be waiting for her.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust leave that part to me. I‚Äôve got it all planned out. There‚Äôs just one thing. You can‚Äôt interfere, no matter what.  You got it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just supposed to blend in?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúExactly. You might see some things you don‚Äôt like, but stay out of it. Eventually, they‚Äôll bring me inside the house.  Just wait five minutes, and the living room window will open.  You need to be right there, by that window.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúKeep your eyes on me, you‚Äôll be able to see me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd when I raise my hand like this‚Ä¶ you throw this into the room and yell ‚ÄòFire!‚Äô  Got it?  Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs nothing dangerous.‚Äù  He pulled something out of his pocket that looked like a big cigar.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a smoke flare, plumbers use them.  Lights on both ends.  That‚Äôs your job, simple as that.  Once you yell ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù, other people will hear and join in.  Then you head down to the end of the street, and I‚Äôll meet you in ten minutes.  You got all that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ I do nothing, I go to the window, I watch for your signal, I throw that thing inside, yell ‚ÄòFire!‚Äô,  and wait for you at the corner.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPerfect. I knew I could count on you.\"\n\n‚ÄúSo, what exactly is the plan?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAll in good time. It‚Äôs almost time for me to get into character anyway.‚Äù\n\nHe went back to his room and came back a few minutes later dressed like a really nice, but maybe not too bright, priest.  He had on a big black hat, baggy pants, one of those white ties priests wear, and he had this kind of goofy smile that would make you trust him instantly. It was more than just the clothes; his whole demeanor changed. You‚Äôd think he was a completely different person! What a shame he became a detective. He would‚Äôve been an amazing actor.\n\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and about ten to seven when we got to Serpentine Avenue. The sun was setting, streetlights were starting to come on, and we were hanging out in front of Briony Lodge, waiting.  It looked exactly like Holmes described, but there were more people around than I expected.  For a small street, it was pretty lively. A bunch of guys were smoking and laughing on the corner, there was a guy sharpening knives with one of those wheels, a couple of soldiers were flirting with a nanny, and some upper-class guys were strutting around smoking cigars.  \n\n\"See,‚Äù said Holmes, ‚Äúthe marriage actually makes things simpler. The photo‚Äôs a problem for both of them now. She doesn‚Äôt want her new hubby to see it any more than our friend wants his fianc√©e to see it.  Question is, where is it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood question.\"\n\n‚ÄúNo way she‚Äôs carrying it around with her. It‚Äôs too big.  She knows the King‚Äôs men might try to mug her ‚Äì which they already did twice, remember? So yeah, it‚Äôs not on her.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen where is it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe her bank? Or a lawyer‚Äôs office? Those are possibilities, but my gut says no.  Women like their secrets, and they like to keep them close. Why trust someone else?  Plus, she‚Äôs planning on using it soon.  Has to be somewhere she can grab it quickly.  It‚Äôs in her house.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs been robbed twice already.\"\n\n‚ÄúThose guys were amateurs, they wouldn't know a clue if it hit ‚Äòem in the face.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd you do?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to look for it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not?  Then how‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll get her to show me, it‚Äôs foolproof.\"\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never go for it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt have a choice. Wait, I hear wheels.  It‚Äôs her.‚Äù\n\nJust as he said it, we saw the lights of a carriage.  A fancy little thing pulled up. One of the guys from the corner ran up to open the door, hoping for a tip, but one of the other guys shoved him out of the way. They got into a huge yelling match, then the soldiers got involved, and the knife-sharpener jumped in too, waving his tools around.  Punches flew, and suddenly this woman, who‚Äôd gotten out of the carriage, was right in the middle of this brawl! Holmes jumped into the chaos to protect her, but as soon as he reached her, he cried out and fell to the ground, blood all over his face. The soldiers and the other guys disappeared, and a bunch of well-dressed people who‚Äôd been watching the fight suddenly rushed forward to help the woman and check on the ‚Äúinjured‚Äù man. Irene Adler, as I still thought of her, ran up the steps to her front door but turned to look back at the commotion.\n\n‚ÄúIs the poor man badly hurt?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead!‚Äù shouted some. \n\n‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs alive!‚Äù shouted others. ‚ÄúBut he won‚Äôt make it to the hospital in time.\"\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a brave man,‚Äù said one woman.  ‚ÄúThose thugs were after her purse and her jewels! They‚Äôd have gotten away with it if he hadn't stepped in.  Oh look, he‚Äôs breathing again!\"\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just leave him here in the street!  Can we bring him inside, miss?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course, of course!  Bring him into the sitting room, there‚Äôs a comfortable sofa in there. This way, quickly!‚Äù\n\nThey carefully carried him into the house.  I was watching from my post by the window. They‚Äôd turned on the lights inside, but the curtains weren‚Äôt drawn.  I could see them laying Holmes down on the sofa. Part of me thought he looked guilty about tricking everyone, but honestly, I was the one who felt bad.  Here was this elegant, kind woman, and we were setting her up! But it would be betraying Holmes to back out now.  So I told myself, we‚Äôre not really hurting her, we‚Äôre just stopping her from hurting someone else.\n\nHolmes sat up, pretending like he couldn‚Äôt breathe.  A maid rushed over and opened the window wide.  That was it, that was my cue.  I saw Holmes raise his hand, and I chucked that smoke bomb into the room, yelling \"Fire!‚Äù  As soon as the words left my mouth, everyone started shouting ‚ÄúFire! Fire!‚Äù  There was smoke everywhere, pouring out of the window.  I saw people running around, then I heard Holmes yelling that it was a false alarm.  I pushed through the crowd to the corner of the street and ten minutes later, there was Holmes! We hightailed it out of there.  We didn‚Äôt talk until we were a few blocks away, heading toward Edgeware Road.\n\n‚ÄúYou were great, Watson,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt have gone better. Got it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou got the photo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI know where it is.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep me in suspense, how did you find it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe showed me!  Just like I said she would.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to say anything before,\" Holmes said, laughing, \"but it was all so easy! All those people, they were in on it. Hired for the night.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI had a hunch.\"\n\n‚ÄúSo when that fight broke out, I had some red paint in my hand. Simple trick: I ‚Äòtripped,‚Äô fell down, ‚Äòhurt‚Äô my face, and voila!  Instant victim! Classic move.\"\n\n‚ÄúOkay, I get that part.\"\n\n‚ÄúThey had to bring me inside, she didn't have a choice! And where‚Äôd they take me? The sitting room, just like I thought. It was either that room or her bedroom, and I had to see which one. They laid me on the couch, I pretended to faint, they opened the window for air ‚Äì bingo! Opportunity knocked, eh Watson?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut how did that help you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was everything!  You see, when a woman thinks her house is on fire, she instinctively grabs whatever she cares about most.  It's like a reflex, people panic, and I‚Äôve used that to my advantage more than once. Helped me crack the Darlington case and that whole mess at Arnsworth Castle, too. Married women grab their babies, single women grab their jewelry.  I knew this woman, she doesn‚Äôt care about jewels as much as that photo. She‚Äôd go straight for it. And the fire? Perfect! Smoke, shouting, enough to rattle anyone.  She reacted perfectly. The photo‚Äôs hidden behind a panel above the right bell pull. She went straight there when I yelled ‚ÄòFire!‚Äô and I saw it!  Just a glimpse, as she was putting it back.  Then I said it was a false alarm, she gave me this look, saw the smoke bomb, and ran out. Haven't seen her since.  I got up, said I was fine, and got out. I thought about grabbing the photo then and there, but the coachman was watching me, so I figured it was safer to wait.  Gotta be careful not to rush things.\"\n\n‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs practically done!  I‚Äôll go back tomorrow with the King, and you can come too if you want. We‚Äôll hang out in the sitting room, wait for her to come back ‚Äì although she won‚Äôt find us, or the photo, when she does.  I‚Äôm sure His Majesty would like to get it back personally.\"\n\n‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEight in the morning.  She won‚Äôt be up by then. Plus, we need to do this before she gets any ideas about changing her routine now that she‚Äôs married. I have to send a telegram to the King.‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôd gotten back to Baker Street.  As Holmes was looking for his key, someone walked by and said, ‚ÄúEvening, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.‚Äù\n\nThere were a few other people on the street, but the voice came from a young guy in a long coat who hurried past us. \n\n‚ÄúI know that voice‚Ä¶\" muttered Holmes, peering down the dark street.  ‚ÄúNow who in the world was that?‚Äù\n\nI crashed at his place that night, and the next morning, we were having breakfast when the King of Bohemia came barging in, a wild look in his eyes. \n\n‚ÄúYou got it!  Tell me you got it!‚Äù he said, grabbing Holmes and shaking him. \n\n‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù Holmes said.\n\n‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre hopeful?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHopeful.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs go!  I can‚Äôt wait any longer!\" \n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to get a cab.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMine‚Äôs waiting. Come on!\"\n\nWe headed down to Briony Lodge.  \"Irene Adler got married yesterday,‚Äù Holmes said casually.\n\n‚ÄúWhat? Married? Yesterday?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYep.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTo who?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEnglish lawyer, fellow by the name of Godfrey Norton.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut she couldn't possibly love him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, I hope she does.\"\n\n‚ÄúWhy on earth would you hope that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause if she loves her husband, she doesn‚Äôt love you. And if she doesn‚Äôt love you, you‚Äôve got nothing to worry about. No reason for her to ruin your marriage.\"\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true, I suppose.  Still‚Ä¶ You know, she would‚Äôve been",

Anyway, my walk took me through Baker Street, and as I passed our old place, which brought back a lot of memories, I suddenly felt this urge to see Holmes again and find out what he was up to. His windows were blazing with light, and as I looked up, I saw his tall, skinny shadow moving back and forth. He was pacing like crazy, his head down, hands behind his back. I knew him like the back of my hand, and this meant only one thing: he was on a case. He'd shaken off whatever druggy haze he was in and was hot on the trail of something new. I rang the bell. He wasn't exactly what you'd call warm and fuzzy when he opened the door, but I could tell he was happy to see me. He just waved me into our old room without saying much. He pointed to his cigars and drinks, then stood by the fireplace, just studying me with those intense eyes. \"Marriage looks good on you,\" he said, out of nowhere. \"I'd say you've put on about seven and a half pounds since I last saw you.\" \"Seven?\" I said. \"Yeah, actually, maybe a bit more. Just a tad, I'd say. And you're back at work, I see. You didn't tell me you were going back to being a doctor.\" \"How did you know?\" \"Figured it out. It's obvious. Like, it's pretty clear you've been caught in the rain lately and that you have a totally useless maid.\" \"Holmes, how on earth‚Ä¶?\" I started, but he cut me off. He chuckled and rubbed his hands together like he was about to tell a joke. \"Elementary, my dear Watson! My eyes tell me that on your left shoe, right where the firelight hits it, the leather has six little cuts on it, all almost perfectly parallel. Obviously, someone scraped the mud off your shoes, but did a terrible job. Hence, my friend, you were out in awful weather and you have a maid who should be fired immediately. As for your work, let's just say that when a guy comes in here reeking of medical stuff, has a black stain on his finger, and a lump in his coat pocket shaped exactly like a stethoscope, well, I'd have to be blind not to realize he's a doctor.\" I couldn't help but laugh; he made it seem so easy! \"When you explain it,\" I said, \"it's always so simple. I feel like I could do it too, but then you hit me with another one of your deductions, and I'm clueless again. My eyes are as good as yours, though!\" \"Sure they are,\" he said, lighting a cigarette and slumping into a chair. \"The thing is, you see, but you don't observe. Big difference. For example, you've seen the steps up to this room how many times?\" \"A lot!\" \"How many, exactly?\" \"I don't know, hundreds?\" \"Exactly! You haven't observed. But you've seen them. That's my whole point. Now me, I've both seen and observed, so I know there are seventeen steps. Speaking of little mysteries, since you like that sort of thing and you're writing down all our adventures, this might interest you.\" He threw a pink piece of paper at me. \"Came in the mail just now,\" he said. \"Read it out loud.\"",

Be a shame to miss it.\" \"But what about your client?\" \"Don't you worry about him, I may need your help and so might he. Ah, here he is. You just sit tight and listen closely.\" We heard heavy footsteps coming up the stairs and then a loud, commanding knock. \"Come in!\" shouted Holmes. The guy who walked in was huge, at least six foot six, built like a tank. He was dressed super expensively, but in a way that would be considered pretty tacky in England. His coat was trimmed with fur, and he had this huge emerald brooch holding his cloak closed. He took off his hat as he came in, but the top half of his face was covered with a black mask. He looked like he'd just put it on because his hand was still on it. You could tell he was a strong-willed guy just from the lower half of his face; he had this thick, frowning mouth and a stubborn-looking chin. \"You got my note?\" he asked. His voice was deep and rough, and he had a thick German accent. \"I said I'd come.\" He glanced back and forth between me and Holmes. \"Have a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, he helps me out with cases sometimes. Who should I say is calling?\" \"You can call me Count Von Kramm,\" he said. \"A Bohemian nobleman. This gentleman, your friend, I assume he's trustworthy and can keep a secret? This is a matter of utmost importance. Otherwise, I prefer to speak with you alone.\" I started to get up, but Holmes grabbed my wrist and pulled me back down. \"Either he stays,\" Holmes said, \"or you're talking to an empty room. What you say to me, you can say in front of him.\" The Count shrugged. \"Very well,\" he said. \"First, I need your word that you will both keep this absolutely secret for two years. After that, it won't matter. But right now, let's just say it's a big deal. Could even change European history, important stuff.\" \"I promise,\" said Holmes. \"Me too,\" I said. \"You'll excuse the mask,\" he continued. \"The person I work for, he wants to remain anonymous. Truth be told, \"Count\" isn't exactly my real title either.\" \"I knew that already,\" Holmes said casually. \"This is a delicate situation,\" the Count said. \"We need to be careful to prevent a massive scandal that could seriously damage one of the most important families in Europe. To put it bluntly, this involves the House of Ormstein, the royal family of Bohemia.\" \"Yeah, figured that out too,\" mumbled Holmes, getting comfortable in his chair and closing his eyes like he was bored. Our visitor seemed surprised. He was probably expecting the most brilliant detective in the world to be a bit more‚Ä¶ alert. Holmes opened his eyes slowly and looked impatiently at his client. \"If you would be so kind as to tell me what's going on,\" he said, \"then perhaps I could help you.\" The guy jumped up and started pacing, really agitated. Finally, he ripped the mask off his face and chucked it on the floor. \"You're right!\" he shouted, \"I'm the King! No point hiding it!\" \"You're telling me,\" Holmes said under his breath. \"I knew I was talking to Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and King of Bohemia before you even said a word.\" \"Of course, of course,\" said the King, sitting back down and wiping his brow. \"But I don't usually do business like this, you know? But this situation, it's just so sensitive. I couldn't trust anyone else to handle it. I had to come to London in disguise just to talk to you.\" \"Well then, by all means, let's talk,\" said Holmes, closing his eyes again. \"Here's the deal: about five years ago, I was in Warsaw for a while and I met this woman, quite the character, name of Irene Adler. You've heard of her?\" \"Look her up in my files, would you, Watson?\" Holmes said, not even bothering to open his eyes. He kept these meticulous records on everyone and everything; it was amazing. I found her file wedged between a rabbi and a naval officer who'd written about fish. \"Let's see‚Ä¶,\" said Holmes. \"Hmm, born in New Jersey, 1858. Contralto‚Ä¶ interesting. Sang at La Scala‚Ä¶ impressive. Lead singer at the Imperial Opera in Warsaw, no less. Retired from singing, huh? Living in London now, is she? Let me guess, Your Majesty, you had a little fling with this woman, wrote some letters you probably shouldn't have, and now you want them back?\" \"That's right! But how did you‚Ä¶?\" \"Tell me, was there a secret marriage?\" \"No.\" \"Any legal documents? A marriage certificate?\" \"Nothing at all.\" \"Then I'm not sure I understand the problem, Your Majesty. If this woman tries to blackmail you with these letters, how can she prove they're real?\" \"The handwriting.\" \"Please, that's easy to fake.\" \"It was on my personal stationery.\" \"Could've been stolen.\" \"It has my seal on it.\" \"Someone could've copied it.\" \"My photo's in it!\" \"Could've bought that.\" \"We're both in the photo!\" \"Oh dear, that's not good. You really messed up this time.\" \"I was a fool! Out of my mind!\" \"This is serious. You've compromised yourself.\" \"I was just the Crown Prince back then, I was young and stupid! I'm only thirty now!\" \"We have to get that photo back.\" \"We've tried everything, nothing worked.\" \"You'll have to pay her. Buy it back.\" \"She won't sell.\" \"Then we'll have to steal it.\" \"We tried that five times already! My guys broke into her house twice. Once we stole her luggage when she was traveling. And she was ambushed twice. Nothing!\" \"Didn't find a single clue?\" \"Nothing.\" Holmes chuckled. \"This is quite a little problem, isn't it?\" \"It's a huge problem for me,\" the King said. \"You're right, it is. So what's she going to do with this photo?\" \"Ruin me.\" \"But how?\" \"I'm about to get married.\" \"So I've heard.\" \"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, the Scandinavian King's second daughter. You must know her family is very strict. And she's the picture of innocence. Even the tiniest whiff of scandal would end things instantly.\" \"And Irene Adler?\" \"She's going to send them that photo, I know she will. You don't know her, she's got a will of iron. Most beautiful woman you've ever seen, but with the mind of a ruthless criminal. She'll do anything to stop me from marrying this other woman, anything.\" \"You're certain she hasn't sent the photo yet?\" \"Positive.\" \"Why are you so sure?\" \"Because she told me she would send it the day the engagement is announced. This Monday.\" \"Well, good thing we have three days then,\" Holmes said, yawning. \"I've got a couple of loose ends to tie up at the moment. Your Majesty will be staying in London for the time being, I presume?\" \"Of course, of course. You can reach me at the Langham Hotel, under the name Count Von Kramm.\" \"I'll let you know how things are going.\" \"Please do, I'm on pins and needles over here.\" \"Now, about payment‚Ä¶\" \"Don't worry about it, the sky's the limit.\" \"Seriously?\" \"I'd give you one of my provinces for that photo, I'm not kidding.\" \"And for expenses?\" The King took out a fat leather bag and tossed it on the table. \"Three hundred in gold, seven hundred in cash,\" he said. Holmes scribbled him a receipt. \"And the lady's address?\" \"Briony Lodge, on Serpentine Avenue in St. John's Wood.\" Holmes wrote it down. \"Just one more thing: was the photo a cabinet card?\" \"Yes, it was.\" \"Right then, good night, Your Majesty. I think we'll have good news for you soon. And good night to you too, Watson,\" he said as we heard the royal carriage pulling away. \"Come by tomorrow afternoon around three, we'll talk about this whole thing.\"",

                    "text_segment": "At three o'clock sharp, I was back on Baker Street. No sign of Holmes. His landlady said he'd left early that morning. So I sat by the fire, waiting. I have to admit, this case had really piqued my interest. Even though it wasn't a murder or anything, something about the mystery of the missing photo, and who this Irene Adler really was, not to mention having a king as a client, made it all very intriguing. Plus, it was fascinating to watch Holmes work; he was so incredibly sharp and observant. I was so used to him being right that I never even considered the possibility of him failing. It was almost four when he finally showed up, looking like he'd been on a bender! He had on these shabby clothes, his face was red and kind of swollen, and he had these ridiculous sideburns. I knew Holmes was a master of disguise, but I swear, I had to look three times before I was sure it was really him! He gave me a quick nod and disappeared into his bedroom. Five minutes later, he came out, back to his normal self, wearing his usual tweed suit. He shoved his hands in his pockets, stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and burst out laughing. \"You are not going to believe this!\" he said, but then he started choking and laughing so hard he could barely breathe. \"What? What is it?\" I asked. \"It's just‚Ä¶ too perfect. You'll never guess what I've been up to all day!\" \"I can't even imagine. I'm assuming you went to check out Miss Adler's place and see what she's like?\" \"Bingo. But you won't believe what happened! I left here around eight this morning, dressed as a groom who was out of work. Guys who like horses always stick together, did you know that? Easy to blend in, and you learn all sorts of things. Found Briony Lodge easy enough. Small, but nice, with a garden in the back, right on the street. Two floors. Basic lock on the door. Big living room on the right with those huge windows - easy to open, even a kid could do it. Nothing much in the back, except that you could reach the passage window from the roof of the coach house. I walked around the whole place, checked it out good, but didn't see anything else important. \"So I headed down to the end of the street where I figured there'd be stables, and I was right. I helped the stable boys groom the horses and got a couple pennies, some watered-down beer, a few cigarettes, and more information than I could ever want about our Miss Adler - not to mention all the gossip about half the neighborhood! Not that I cared about them, but I had to pretend to be interested.\" \"And what about Irene Adler? What did you learn?\" \"Let's just say all the guys were head over heels for her, she's quite a looker, apparently. The prettiest woman any of them had ever seen. That's what they all said at the stables, anyway. Quiet life: sings at concerts, goes for a drive at five, home for dinner at seven sharp. Doesn't go out much other than for her concerts. Has this one guy who visits her a lot - a good-looking fella with dark hair. Comes at least once a day, sometimes twice. Name's Godfrey Norton, lawyer. See, being a cabby, you learn all sorts of juicy gossip. They'd driven him home often enough to know everything about him. So after getting all the dirt, I strolled past Briony Lodge again, planning my next move. \"This Godfrey Norton guy, he's a big part of this, I can tell. Lawyer, that's never good. Had to figure out what their deal was. Is she his client? Friend? Or something more? Client, maybe she gave him the photo. If they were involved, less likely. That was the question, and the answer would determine if I should focus on her place or his. Tricky situation. Sorry to bore you with all this, but if you're going to write all this down, I have to give you the details, right?\" \"Don't worry, I'm following,\" I told him. He continued, \"I was still trying to figure out what to do when a cab pulled up, and this guy jumped out. He fit the description perfectly: handsome, dark, mustache. Clearly the Norton fellow. And in a hurry, too. Yelled at the cabby to wait, practically pushed past the maid. \"He was inside maybe half an hour, pacing back and forth, talking with his hands, totally worked up. I couldn't get a look at her. Then he came out, even more flustered than before. Checked his watch and yelled at the cabby, 'Get me to Gross & Hankey's on Regent Street, then St. Monica's Church on Edgeware Road - and make it snappy, twenty minutes! You'll get an extra shilling!' Off they went, and I was trying to decide if I should follow them, when a fancy little carriage came up. Coachman looked a mess, but the woman who came rushing out of the house and into the carriage, she was beautiful! Stunning! \"St. Monica's, John!\" she called out to the driver. \"And there's a half-sovereign in it for you if you get me there in twenty minutes!\" \"Watson, I couldn't resist. This was too good! I was about to chase after them, when an empty cab came by. The driver didn't look too happy to see me, but I got in before he could say anything. 'St. Monica's! And step on it, twenty minutes! There's a reward in it for you!' It was a quarter after eleven, and I knew exactly what was about to happen. \"The cabby got us there fast! I swear, I've never gone that fast in my life. But the other two, they were already there! Their horses were steaming; they must've really pushed them. I paid the cabby and raced inside. There was no one there except for the lovebirds, a priest, and an empty church. They were huddled together by the altar, and the priest looked like he was arguing with them. I pretended to be some lost soul who wandered in and walked casually down the aisle. Suddenly, they all turned and looked at me, and Godfrey Norton came running towards me as fast as he could. \"Thank God!\" he said. \"You'll do. Come on, come on!\" \"What? What's going on?\" I asked. \"No time to explain, man, every second counts! Three minutes, or it won't be legal!\" \"Next thing I know, they've practically dragged me up to the altar, whispering stuff in my ear, and I'm repeating it! Vouching for all these things I know nothing about! Turns out, they needed a witness to make it legal, and there I was, at the right place at the right time! Saved the day! The bride gave me a sovereign; I'm going to have to get myself a pocket watch to wear it on. What a day!\" And that's when he'd started laughing so hard. \"Well, that's a twist,\" I said. \"What happened next?\" \"My carefully laid plans were down the drain, that's what! Looked like they were about to take off, so I had to think fast. But then, at the church door, they took off in different directions: he went back to the Temple, she went home. I heard her say to him, 'See you in the park at five, like always.' And that was that. Time to figure something else out.\" \"And‚Ä¶ what exactly are we going to do?\" \"Let's eat first, then I'll explain everything. It's almost five now, we need to be ready in two hours. Miss Irene - or Mrs. Norton, I guess - will be home from her drive around seven. We'll be waiting for her.\" \"And then what?\" \"Just leave that part to me. I've got it all planned out. There's just one thing. You can't interfere, no matter what. You got it?\" \"I'm just supposed to blend in?\" \"Exactly. You might see some things you don't like, but stay out of it. Eventually, they'll bring me inside the house. Just wait five minutes, and the living room window will open. You need to be right there, by that window.\" \"Got it.\" \"Keep your eyes on me, you'll be able to see me.\" \"Okay.\" \"And when I raise my hand like this‚Ä¶ you throw this into the room and yell 'Fire!' Got it? Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous.\" He pulled something out of his pocket that looked like a big cigar. \"It's a smoke flare, plumbers use them. Lights on both ends. That's your job, simple as that. Once you yell 'Fire!', other people will hear and join in. Then you head down to the end of the street, and I'll meet you in ten minutes. You got all that?\" \"Let's see‚Ä¶ I do nothing, I go to the window, I watch for your signal, I throw that thing inside, yell 'Fire!', and wait for you at the corner.\" \"Perfect. I knew I could count on you.\" \"So, what exactly is the plan?\" \"All in good time. It's almost time for me to get into character anyway.\" He went back to his room and came back a few minutes later dressed like a really nice, but maybe not too bright, priest. He had on a big black hat, baggy pants, one of those white ties priests wear, and he had this kind of goofy smile that would make you trust him instantly. It was more than just the clothes; his whole demeanor changed. You'd think he was a completely different person! What a shame he became a detective. He would've been an amazing actor.",

He had on a big black hat, baggy pants, one of those white ties priests wear, and he had this kind of goofy smile that would make you trust him instantly.

He's wearing a large black hat, baggy black pants, and a clerical collar. His posture has changed dramatically - he now has a slightly stooped stance, and his face bears a guileless, friendly smile that's entirely unlike his usual sharp expression.\n\nMartin Freeman as Dr. Watson stands nearby, his face a picture of amazement at the complete transformation. He's looking Holmes up and down, clearly impressed by the effectiveness of the disguise. Watson's expression is a mix of admiration and amusement, his eyebrows raised and a slight smile playing on his lips.\n\nThe room's warm lighting highlights the details of Holmes' costume, while casting dramatic shadows that emphasize the theatrical nature of his disguise. The fireplace casts a flickering glow, adding to the atmosphere of anticipation and excitement for the adventure to come.\n\nIn the background, we can see the familiar elements of their shared living space - bookshelves, scientific instruments, and case-related clutter - which now contrast sharply with Holmes' priestly attire. A mirror is visible, showing Holmes' reflection and emphasizing the completeness of his transformation.\n\nOn a nearby table, we can see Holmes' discarded tweed jacket and other elements of his usual attire, serving as a visual reminder of the stark change in his appearance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of anticipation and excitement for the upcoming adventure. The scene perfectly captures Holmes' mastery of disguise and acting, as well as Watson's continual amazement at his friend's skills. It's a moment that encapsulates the thrill and theatricality of their investigations.",

The sun was setting, streetlights were starting to come on, and we were hanging out in front of Briony Lodge, waiting. It looked exactly like Holmes described, but there were more people around than I expected. For a small street, it was pretty lively. A bunch of guys were smoking and laughing on the corner, there was a guy sharpening knives with one of those wheels, a couple of soldiers were flirting with a nanny, and some upper-class guys were strutting around smoking cigars. \"See,\" said Holmes, \"the marriage actually makes things simpler. The photo's a problem for both of them now. She doesn't want her new hubby to see it any more than our friend wants his fianc√©e to see it. Question is, where is it?\" \"Good question.\" \"No way she's carrying it around with her. It's too big. She knows the King's men might try to mug her ‚Äì which they already did twice, remember? So yeah, it's not on her.\" \"Then where is it?\" \"Maybe her bank? Or a lawyer's office? Those are possibilities, but my gut says no. Women like their secrets, and they like to keep them close. Why trust someone else? Plus, she's planning on using it soon. Has to be somewhere she can grab it quickly. It's in her house.\" \"But it's been robbed twice already.\" \"Those guys were amateurs, they wouldn't know a clue if it hit 'em in the face.\" \"And you do?\" \"I'm not going to look for it.\" \"You're not? Then how‚Ä¶?\" \"I'll get her to show me, it's foolproof.\" \"She'll never go for it.\" \"She won't have a choice. Wait, I hear wheels. It's her.\" Just as he said it, we saw the lights of a carriage. A fancy little thing pulled up. One of the guys from the corner ran up to open the door, hoping for a tip, but one of the other guys shoved him out of the way. They got into a huge yelling match, then the soldiers got involved, and the knife-sharpener jumped in too, waving his tools around. Punches flew, and suddenly this woman, who'd gotten out of the carriage, was right in the middle of this brawl! Holmes jumped into the chaos to protect her, but as soon as he reached her, he cried out and fell to the ground, blood all over his face. The soldiers and the other guys disappeared, and a bunch of well-dressed people who'd been watching the fight suddenly rushed forward to help the woman and check on the \"injured\" man. Irene Adler, as I still thought of her, ran up the steps to her front door but turned to look back at the commotion. \"Is the poor man badly hurt?\" she asked. \"He's dead!\" shouted some. \"No, he's alive!\" shouted others. \"But he won't make it to the hospital in time.\" \"He's a brave man,\" said one woman. \"Those thugs were after her purse and her jewels! They'd have gotten away with it if he hadn't stepped in. Oh look, he's breathing again!\" \"We can't just leave him here in the street! Can we bring him inside, miss?\" \"Of course, of course! Bring him into the sitting room, there's a comfortable sofa in there. This way, quickly!\" They carefully carried him into the house. I was watching from my post by the window. They'd turned on the lights inside, but the curtains weren't drawn. I could see them laying Holmes down on the sofa. Part of me thought he looked guilty about tricking everyone, but honestly, I was the one.",

Blood (likely fake, but convincing to onlookers) covers his face as he lies motionless on the cobblestones. The fighting men, seeing this turn of events, quickly disperse and vanish into the night. The well-dressed bystanders who had been watching the fight now rush forward, their faces a mix of concern and curiosity. They gather around Holmes and the woman, creating a circle of worried onlookers.",

The soldiers and the other guys disappeared, and a bunch of well-dressed people who'd been watching the fight suddenly rushed forward to help the woman and check on the \"injured\" man. Irene Adler, as I still thought of her, ran up the steps to her front door but turned to look back at the commotion. \"Is the poor man badly hurt?\" she asked. \"He's dead!\" shouted some. \"No, he's alive!\" shouted others. \"But he won't make it to the hospital in time.\" \"He's a brave man,\" said one woman. \"Those thugs were after her purse and her jewels! They'd have gotten away with it if he hadn't stepped in. Oh look, he's breathing again!\" \"We can't just leave him here in the street! Can we bring him inside, miss?\"",

The fa√ßade of Briony Lodge looms in the background, its windows glowing warmly, offering a stark contrast to the tense scene on the street.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of high drama and tension, with the 'injured' Holmes at the center of a swirling vortex of concern and speculation.
